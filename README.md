# FIRE-SMOKE-ALARM-SYSTEM-FOR-ENCHANTED-SAFETY

The fire smoke alarm is designed to be simple and easy to build. The circuit consists of an Arduino Uno microcontroller, a temperature sensor, a gas sensor, a LED, and a buzzer. The Arduino is programmed to read the output of the temperature sensor and the gas sensor. If the temperature or the gas level exceeds a certain threshold, the Arduino will sound the alarm and light the LED.
